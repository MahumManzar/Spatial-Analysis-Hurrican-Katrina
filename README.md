# Spatial-Analysis-Hurrican-Katrina
Spatial analysis of Hurricane Katrina's impact using GIS

This project evaluates the physical and socioeconomic impacts of Hurricane Katrina along the Gulf Coast using spatial data analysis in ArcGIS.

## Objective
- Assess the path and intensity of Hurricane Katrina.
- Map rainfall patterns, elevation risks, and vulnerable counties.
- Develop a Social Vulnerability Index using census data to identify high-risk areas.

## Features
- **Data Sources**: NOAA hurricane paths, USGS digital elevation models, U.S. Census Bureau socioeconomic data, weather.gov precipitation data.
- **Methods**:
  - Mapped Hurricane Katrina's path and intensity.
  - Analyzed rainfall distribution and identified counties with the heaviest precipitation.
  - Created elevation-based flood risk maps using DEM data.
  - Combined normalized socioeconomic indicators into a Social Vulnerability Index.
- **Outputs**:
  - Multi-layer maps showing physical and social impacts of Hurricane Katrina.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Software**: ArcGIS Pro, Python (for ArcPy automation)
- **Data Formats**: Shapefiles (SHP), DEM, CSV
- **Skills**: Spatial joins, field calculations, symbology optimization, and map design.

## Results
- Highlighted counties most vulnerable to Hurricane Katrina's impacts based on physical and social factors.
- Generated actionable insights to improve hurricane preparedness and disaster response planning.
